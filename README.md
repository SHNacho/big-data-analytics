# Scala and Spark Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my Scala and Spark project! This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Apache Spark and Scala, focusing on applying various machine learning models and preprocessing techniques. The goal is to build a strong understanding of how Spark can be leveraged for large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explore different machine learning algorithms and preprocessing methods using Apache Spark's MLlib. The repository includes scripts and notebooks that demonstrate:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models
- Comparing model performance

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as normalization, standardization, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of various algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees and random forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
